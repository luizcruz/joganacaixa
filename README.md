#  Joga na caixa (Throws in the box)

This is a pet project to backup files in Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage. Improvements are expected (if you can help, would be wonderful).

## Purpose
The function of this script is to back up files from a particular folder in the Google Cloud and Amazon S3 services. Files are sent compressed (to save space) and generate a label locally with the items included in the packet sent. It also has a function that allows searching and downloading a file (package).

## Todo
* Configuration file
* Multi OS version (now it's optmized for OSX)
* Ask for a bucket name on Amazon (you should rename before use)
